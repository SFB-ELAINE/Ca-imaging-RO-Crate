# RO-Crates from Calcium Imaging Experiments

This repository contains [Research Object Crates (RO-Crates)](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1) bundling the research data and their retrospective provenance that was transferred from Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) protocols using an automated structure-based approach.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository contains seven folders that each represents a [RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1) bundle about a Ca-imaging experiment.
The bundle contains a semantic representation of the retrospective provenance of the research data creation (`ro-crate-metadata.json`), i.e., the Ca-imaging procedure.
Furthermore, the research data (`Data`) and a copy of the ELN protocol and the used resources in the form of HTML files (`Protocol`) is contained.
